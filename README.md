## Motivation

This library is used by File Viewer Plugins - for both [OutSystems' Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-outsystems-file-viewer) and [Ionic's Capacitor Plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-file-viewer).

## Usage

In your app-level gradle file, import the `ion-android-fileviewer` library like so:

```
dependencies {
    implementation("io.ionic.libs:ionfileviewer-android:1.0.2")
}
```

## Methods

This section details the methods provided by the `IONFLVWController`:

### Open document from local file path

```kotlin
fun openDocumentFromLocalPath(
    activity: Activity,
    filePath: String
): Result<Unit>
```

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **activity**: the `Activity` from the app using the library to use when for opening the file in another app.
- **filePath**: `String` with the full path to the file.

The method returns a `Result`, that is either success (no data is returned) if file was opened, or an [exception](#errors) that should be handled by the caller app.

### Open document from a remote URL

```kotlin
fun openDocumentFromUrl(
    activity: Activity,
    url: String
): Result<Unit>
```

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **activity**: the `Activity` from the app using the library to use when for opening the url in another app.
- **url**: `String` with the url to open.

The method returns a `Result`, that is either success (no data is returned) if url was opened, or an [exception](#errors) that should be handled by the caller app.


### Open document from app's assets

```kotlin
@WorkerThread
fun openDocumentFromResources(
    activity: Activity,
    assetPath: String
): Result<Unit>
```

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **activity**: the `Activity` from the app using the library to use when for opening the file in another app.
- **assetPath**: `String` with the relative path to the file inside the `assets` folder.

The method returns a `Result`, that is either success (no data is returned) if file was opened, or an [exception](#errors) that should be handled by the caller app.

Unlike the other methods, this cannot be called from the main thread, because it contains I/O operations that could freeze the UI.
You may create a thread using Kotlin's [`thread`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.concurrent/thread.html) function, or use [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html), as exemplified below:

```kotlin
val coroutineScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)
val fileViewerController = IONFLVWController()
coroutineScope.launch {
    fileViewerController.openDocumentFromResources(activity, assetPath)
        .onSuccess {
            // handle file open successfully here
        }
        .onError {
            // handle errors here
        }
}
```

## Errors

The exceptions returned by the plugin method are all of type `IONFLVWException`.

Some exceptions may have a `cause` in case it was thrown outside the controller (e.g. by Android OS).
